# Get started with React Hooks

This is a collection of examples that can help you get started with React Hooks. [View tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/react-hooks).

## Getting Started

Clone or download the project. In the project directory, there are subdirectories that contain specific projects. To run any of them, cd to the project directory and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Prerequisites

If you want to play around with React Hooks, you will need the alpha build of React as this feature is still in alpha (as at the time of writing this article). You also need NPM and Node.js installed locally.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript framework.
